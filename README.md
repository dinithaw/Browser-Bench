# How to use:
	•	Hit Run Benchmark (or Quick Run) to test.
	•	It exercises DOM list ops, input/news feed updates, array crunching, JSON round-trips, layout thrash (forced reflows), canvas drawing, localStorage, and microtasks.
	•	Results show ops/sec per workload and a composite score (geometric mean, scaled). Higher is better.
	•	Use Export JSON to save your run; Reset clears the playground areas.
